-------------------------------------------------
How to compile:
    - cd into the right directory for each problem
        - Problem1
        - Problem2
    % make
    
    No extra steps need to be done for compilation
-------------------------------------------------
How to run it:
Problem1:
    % ./hw02

Problem2:
    % ./mysh
    
-------------------------------------------------
Known Limitations and Error Handling:
=====
Problem01
=====
This problem declares A, B, C matrix, mutex and the seeds all as global variable. I constructed a 2-D pthread_t thread array and then create new threads by calling pthread_create() for each step. I joined the threads after adding values to A, B matrix, evaluating the multiplication results, and finding the MAX SUM ROW respectively. All newly initiated threads are stored in the pthread_t **tid.

In this problem a created a 2-D unsigned int array for seeds to make sure each seed has different values. I am not sure if this is the best choice. And I am not sure if this could also achieved by having only one unsigned int global variable.

========
Problem2 - shell
========
Error handling and Existing problems
1. Keyboard interrupt signals are blocked. Therefore when Ctrl+C is pressed, the shell will just show ^C and ignore the signal
2. when Ctrl+D is entered (EOF as the first symbol), the shell exits
3. This problem only exists on my linux personal machine: part of command does not work for example when entering ls, it prints a series of unrecognizable symbols. Yet when running the program on Mac, everything works just fine. Could be a machine problem.
4. History feature is not yet implemented. 
5. mysh exits when 'exit' is entered
